## 🧩 What Is OmniFi?

**OmniFi** is a cross-chain, smart vault system that lets you bring **real-world assets (RWAs)** like carbon credits into DeFi — with **automated rebalancing**, **live price feeds**, and **secure cross-chain transfers**.

OmniFi combines **Chainlink Automation**, **Data Feeds**, and **CCIP** to build an intelligent DeFi product that adapts to market volatility — and protects your assets.

> 🌱 Tokenize. Rebalance. Transfer.  
> Welcome to climate-friendly, risk-aware DeFi.

---

## 🎥 Walkthrough

1. Users connect MetaMask to OmniFi's frontend.
2. RWAs are tokenized into ERC-20 tokens on Avalanche Fuji (e.g., Carbon Credits).
3. Chainlink **Data Feeds** fetch real-time ETH prices to value deposits.
4. Vaults monitor a custom volatility index. If it exceeds 5%, 
5. Chainlink **Automation** triggers rebalancing across chains.
6. Users can also manually transfer assets across chains via Chainlink **CCIP**.
7. All movements are governed by a mint-and-burn model with strict access control.
